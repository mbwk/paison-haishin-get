Simple little script for checking for specified livestreams on Twitch
and Hitbox.

## Usage:
Very easy to use, and only requires simple configuration in "streams.conf".
Write the name of a streamer you wish to check, followed by a space, then
the name or abbreviation of the streaming service they are on.

Once this is done, simply run the script from within the same directory as
the config file.
